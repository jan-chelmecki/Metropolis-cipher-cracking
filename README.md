# Metropolis cipher cracking

This is a student project implementing a Markov chain attack on a simple substitution cipher (i.e. one for which the key is some permutation of the alphabet).

It was inspired by the lecture notes Probability and Computing by Ryan O'Donnell (Fall 2009 version, page 147 in the pdf), link here:
